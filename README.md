Have you ever had one of those moments when you want to reply to a message using a meme template ?  
This is an attempt to help you quickly do just that.  

## How to use ?
Just run the **meameboard.exe** file, and it should display a list of images in the **pics** directory, along with serial numbers starting from zero.
Just enter the serial number of the image you want to use, and boom !
It will be copied to your clipboard :)

**NOTE:** You can also add meme templates of your own choice in the pics directory, and the tool will load them the next time you open it.

## For Linux/Mac users:
I will soon be adding a script for Linux and Mac.

## Future Releases
In the future, I plan to provide this tool as an electron app that can be invoked using keybindings, and even shows the images as buttons.
So stay tuned :)
