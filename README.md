# meameboard
A meme-response utility for Windows.
Have you ever had one of those moments when you want to reply to a message using a meme template ?
This is an attempt to help you quickly do just that.

## How to use ?
Just run the 'tool.exe' file, and it should display a list on images in the 'pics' directory, along with serial numbers starting from zero.

Just enter the serial number of the image you want to use, and boom !

It will be copied to your clipboard :)
