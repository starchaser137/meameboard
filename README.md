## A meme-response utility for Windows.

Have you ever had one of those moments when you want to reply to a message using a meme template ?  
This is an attempt to help you quickly do just that.  

## How to use ?
## For Linux users:
There is a script available which provides the same functionality, but using an external program called **xclip**.  
You can install it using:  
**apt install xclip**

## For Windows users:
Just run the **meameboard.exe** file, and it should display a list of images in the **pics** directory, along with serial numbers starting from zero.
Just enter the serial number of the image you want to use, and boom !
It will be copied to your clipboard :)

**NOTE:** The **.py** file or the windows executable needs to be in the same directory as **pics** 
for it to work. Also, I have included a small script for Linux users to convert all **.jpg** files in the pics directory to **.png** files, because I couldn't figure out how to copy **jpg** images using Xclip.

## Future Releases
I cannot say anything about this. Its just a small, fun project.
