# meameboard
## A meme-response utility for Windows.
![dog_meme)template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/starchaser137/meameboard/main/source/icon.ico)  

Have you ever had one of those moments when you want to reply to a message using a meme template ?  
This is an attempt to help you quickly do just that.  

## How to use ?
## For Linux users:
There is a script available which provides the same functionality, but using an external program called **xclip**.  
You can install it using 
'''shell
apt install xclip
'''

## For Windows users:
Just run the **meameboard.exe** file, and it should display a list of images in the **pics** directory, along with serial numbers starting from zero.
Just enter the serial number of the image you want to use, and boom !
It will be copied to your clipboard :)

**NOTE:** I have already added some images in the **pics** folder to get you started, but you can also add meme templates of your own choice in the pics directory, and the tool will load them the next time you open it. Also, the **.py** file or the windows executable needs to be in the same directory as **pics** 
for it to work.  

## Future Releases
I cannot say anything about this. Its just a small, fun project.
